# Player Decline of Major League Baseball (MLB) Players by Position
# Project Summary
Determine the data that can be used to predict the relative length, measured in years, of the expected productivity for baseball players by position before an organization is required to execute a replacement plan for players by position.  This project assumes normal baseball operations and does not account for the impact that injuries, free agency or other factors that might influence player productivity.  Gaining insight into this dilemma will help MLB organizations draft and develop players according to the length and maximum output at the position.
